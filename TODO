* try doing a single advanced indexing operation for the entire batch. Then slice the resulting array in each iteration.

* test on GTX 680

* profile and figure out a way to speed this up, it's pretty slow.
    not recomputing Y_e every time for each batch update might help.
    GpuAdvancedSubtensor1 seems to be the culprit.

* implement destructive version of BatchMatrixInvOp (although for now it only takes up 10% of the time so it's not worth optimizing)
